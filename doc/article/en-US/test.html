    Every narrative section gets a "uid" to map translations in.
    The "version" indicates the version of the content contained inside the tag.
    The Major component changes when there are "breaking changes" in content that completely invalidate translations.
    The Minor component changes when new content is added without changing old content. It indicates that translatations are still valid, but missing some new info.
    When typos, grammar or other changes are made which don't change the meaning or content of the narrative, the version can have its patch component bumped, but it's basically ignored.
    When the docs are rendered in non-English translations, indicators will be shown if there is new content or if the content is no longer valid.
    If there is a new narrative section for which there is no translation, that will be indicated.
